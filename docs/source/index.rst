My name is Nhut Nguyen. I am a C++ Software Developer in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I was born and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In 2012, I moved to Denmark for a Ph.D. in mathematics at the Technical University of Denmark. After the study, I switched to the industry in 2016 and have worked at various tech companies in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I love to share my experience and lessons I learned from my life and work through books and articles.
